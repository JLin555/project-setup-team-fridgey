Our Minimum Viable Product includes the implementation of user-stories 1-3, corresponding to the themes of fridge management and shopping list planning. 

### Fridge Management 
1. As a busy college student, I want to be able to track all of the food in my fridge so that it doesnâ€™t spoil.
2. As a busy college student, I want to be able to check on the ingredients in my fridge on the go so that I can plan what I want to make later when I get back home.

### Shopping List Planning
3. As a busy college student, I want to be able to plan my shopping list ahead of time so that I know what to buy when I go to the grocery store.

### Exploration
4. As a busy college student, I want to be more informed about the recommended storage time of certain foods so that I can plan my meals ahead of time.
5. As a beginner chef, I want to see new possible recipes I can make from the ingredients in my fridge so that I can make new meals.

# History
Fridgey is a mobile/web app that wants to become your go-to place for at-home food management. The app aims to help users track the food in their fridge, notify users when their food is going bad, provide simple analytics on what types of food are in their fridge, and even provide recommendations on what food they should buy next or what recipes they should try based on the food in their fridge with built-in shopping lists.

To date, the Fridgey team has completed a wireframe and clickable prototype for the application.
